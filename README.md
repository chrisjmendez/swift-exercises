SWIFT Exercises
===

Like strumming on a guitar or painting on Adobe Illustrator, I always do better learning through exercises. This collection is organized by theme and aims to explain how to to port Objective-C solutions for SWIFT. 

###Advertising
Although there are dozens of ways to make money ([Jude Gomila's list](http://blog.judegomila.com/post/49038646693/101-business-models), [Crowdsourced List](https://hackpad.com/Web-and-Mobile-Revenue-Models-Ch2paBpUyIU)), advertising –or underwriting for you not-for-profit friends– is still a sucessful model ([Flappy Success](http://www.businessinsider.com/flappy-bird-is-doing-50000-in-revenue-per-day-2014-2), [Quora Ad mathematics](http://www.quora.com/How-is-it-even-possible-for-Flappy-Bird-to-be-making-50K-day))
- Heyzap: Heyzap is great because it allows me to use Admob, Applovin, Facebook Ad Network and iAds through a single SDK.

###Analytics
Measuring your app is any developer's first key step towards Management.
- Flurry: Yahoo's Flurry analytics is very good at logging events. 
- Google Analytics: Coming Soon. 

###User registration and authentication
As a mobile producer, if you want provide your users with a customizable, personalized experience, you'll need a Back-end as a Service of soem sort)
- Parse: Coming Soon
- Firebase: Coming Soon

###Basic
As a new student of SWIFT, I found these simple examples were successful in helping me quickly learn XCode and SWIFT. 
- HTTPRequests: This is a cleaner, more organized approach to GET, POST, and Download requests.
- ActionSheet: A simple ActionSheet example.
- AlertView: Basic AlertView example
- Countdown: Basic 30 second countdown example.
- POSTRequest: Plan, vanilla POST requests.

###Concurrency
Any mobile producer will tell you that performance is a big deal when it comes to creating a successful user experience. Concurrency is a big topic so I gave it its own /folder.

###GUI
User experience is the holy grail for digital progress.  The only way we, as a humanity, will move beyond the Windoew's era is to invest all the computational power (new devices are promising) back into user interface and design. 
- UIX: Throttle-like GUI.

###Music
My first music app was developed in 2010 so it's safe to say I'm a music tech producer. The collection of exercices here are simply aimed at getting me to script-bridge my brain to SWIFT.
- AudioPlayer: Vanilla MP3 player.
- iTunesQuery: Search for something through iTunes API and package the results.

###Social
What makes the Internet better than print or broadcast is that there's a two-way interaction. OK, fine, reality-tv sort of captured the essence of "average people entertaining other average people" but Social Media is a better extension. Some call it peer-to-peer, others call it "platform" but all these exercices attempt to do is help devs learn how to authenticate their apps using oAuth2.

- Twitter Integration: Coming soon

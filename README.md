SWIFT Exercises
===

Like strumming a guitar or painting on Adobe Illustrator, I always learn more through exercises. This collection is organized by theme and aims to explore how to to port Objective-C solutions for SWIFT. As a mobile app producer, I find that any app I build requires me to think about: users, money, marketing, measurement, product design + performance, and customer support. I've opted to organize my exercices using this lose structure. 


###User registration and authentication
As a mobile producer, if you want provide your users with a customizable, personalized experience, you'll need a Back-end as a Service of soem sort)
- [Parse](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Authentication/Parse): Basic Parse examples of Register, Log in, Log out
- Firebase: Coming Soon


###Money
Although there are dozens of ways to make money ([Jude Gomila's list](http://blog.judegomila.com/post/49038646693/101-business-models), [Crowdsourced List](https://hackpad.com/Web-and-Mobile-Revenue-Models-Ch2paBpUyIU)), advertising –or underwriting for you not-for-profit friends– is still a sucessful model ([Flappy Success](http://www.businessinsider.com/flappy-bird-is-doing-50000-in-revenue-per-day-2014-2), [Quora Ad mathematics](http://www.quora.com/How-is-it-even-possible-for-Flappy-Bird-to-be-making-50K-day))
- [Heyzap](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Advertising/Heyzap): Heyzap is great because it allows me to use Admob, Applovin, Facebook Ad Network and iAds through a single SDK.
- [Yahoo Flurry AD banner](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Advertising/FlurryAdBanner): Simple Banner Ad, Simple Interstitial Ad
- [iAD](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Advertising/iAD/Advanced): Simple Interstitial Ad


###Measurement
Measuring your app is any developer's first key step towards Management.
- [Flurry](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Analytics/Flurry): Yahoo's Flurry analytics is very good at logging events. 
- Google Analytics: Coming Soon. 


###Product Design
User experience is the holy grail for digital progress.  The only way we, as a humanity, will move beyond the Windoew's era is to invest all the computational power (new devices are promising) back into user interface and design. 
- [UIX](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/GUI/UIX): Throttle-like GUI.


###Product Samples
As a new student of SWIFT, I found these simple examples were successful in helping me quickly learn XCode and SWIFT. 
- [HTTPRequests](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Basic/HTTPRequests): This is a cleaner, more organized approach to GET, POST, and Download requests.
- [ActionSheet](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Basic/ActionSheet): A simple ActionSheet example.
- [AlertView](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Basic/AlertView): Basic AlertView example
- [Countdown](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Basic/Countdown): Basic 30 second countdown example.
- [POSTRequest](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Basic/POSTRequest): Plan, vanilla POST requests.
- ProteinTracker: Example of a calculator


###Games
- [Flappy Clone](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Games/FlappyBirdClone): Flappy Birds clone.
- [Basic Quiz](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Basic/Quiz): Simple question-based quiz


###Product Performance
Any mobile producer will tell you that performance is a big deal when it comes to creating a successful user experience. Concurrency is a big topic so I gave it its own /folder.
- [Simple Dispatch Queues](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Concurrency/Dispatch%20Queues)
- [Operational Queues](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Concurrency/Operational%20Queues)


###Music
My first music app was developed in 2010 so it's safe to say I'm a music tech producer. The collection of exercices here are simply aimed at getting me to script-bridge my brain to SWIFT.
- [AudioPlayer](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Music/AudioPlayer): Vanilla MP3 player.
- [iTunesQuery](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Music/iTunesQuery): Search for something through iTunes API and package the results.


###Marketing
What makes the Internet better than print or broadcast is that there's a two-way interaction. OK, fine, reality-tv sort of captured the essence of "average people entertaining other average people" but Social Media is a better extension. Some call it peer-to-peer, others call it "platform" but all these exercices attempt to do is help devs learn how to authenticate their apps using oAuth2. 
- [Facebook Integration](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Social/Facebook): Coming soon
- Twitter Integration: Coming soon


###Internationalization
- [Convert Local Calendar](https://github.com/chrisjmendez/swift-exercises/tree/master/Basic/Convert%20Local%20Calendar): Calculate calendar times for different countries.

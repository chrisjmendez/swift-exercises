What
-
Google ADMob is a platform where digital revenue managers can sell inventory to AD networks. Examples of inventory include: a *sponsorship*, a *targeted campaign*, a *standard advertisement*, *overstocked inventory* (as surplus, bulk, or low cost) or *HouseAds*.

Why
- 
ADMob is very much like DoubleClick but it was originally created to serve mobile devices. Since Google acquisition of ADmob, it has integrated both products.  So a DoubleClick vendor can now create an AD Unit and have it appear on a mobile device through ADmob. 

If a specific advertiser isn't a DoubleClick user, that's OK, they can also create an AD Unit through ADmob.  

*ADMob and DoubleClick are simply two of the same product with potentially different sets of customers.*
